# **Welcome to our contributing guide**
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project. Please read and follow the contributing guidelines.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## **Create a branch**
- Please create a separate branch for each issue or improvement that you're working on. Do not make changes to the default branch (e.g. master) of your fork.

## **Push your code ASAP**
- Push your code as soon as you can. Follow the "early and often" rule.
- Make a pull request as soon as you can and mark the title with a "[WIP]". You can create a draft pull request.

## **Describe your Pull Request**
- Add an issue number. Tag the actual issue number by replacing #[issue_number] e.g. #42. This closes the issue when your PR is merged.
- Add the issue author name [Your name]. Tag the actual issue author by replacing @[author] e.g. @issue_author. This brings the reporter of the issue into the conversation.
- Add a list task for checking if required. Add a checklist.
- Describe your change in detail.
- Describe how you tested your change.

## **Request review**
- Once your PR is ready, remove the "[WIP]" from the title and/or change it from a draft PR to a regular PR.
- If a specific reviewer is not assigned automatically, please request a review from the project maintainer and any other interested parties manually.

## **Incorporating feedback**
- If your PR gets a 'Changes requested' review, you will need to address the feedback and update your PR by pushing to the same branch. Do not close the PR and open a new one.
- Re-request review once you have made changes after a code review. Please make it clear what changes did you address.
